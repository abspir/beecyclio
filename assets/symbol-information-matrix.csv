Forest Certified,FSC stands for Forest Stewardship Council and this symbol means the material has been made from wood sourced from a responsibly-managed forest that complies with the FSC's independent guidelines.,fcs
Aluminium,"This symbol means that the product is made from recyclable aluminium - and yes, that includes foil. Just make sure there's no crumbs or food left on the foil, and try and scrunch it up into a ball - the bigger the ball, the easier it is to recycle.",
Compostable,"The threaded-through leaf means that an item is compostable. It's important not to put these items in your normal recycling - they actually cannot be recycled. Pop them in with your garden waste (if you don't have a garden waste bin, your council will provide one).",
Check Locally,"A white circular arrow on a black background means that it is recycled by 20%-75% of UK regions, so the best thing to do is to check with your local council beforehand.",
Tidyman,This symbol is part of the Keep Britain Tidy initiative. It doesn't actually have anything to do with recycling but acts as a reminder to dispose of your waste properly.,
Financial Contribution,This one's a bit of a weirdo one - two interlocking green arrows means that the manufacturers have made a financial contribution to recycling services in Europe. It doesn't mean the product itself is recyclable.,
Widely Recycled,"If you see this symbol on the back of a product, it means it's widely recycled (by 75% or more of local authorities across the UK).",
Plastics,"Three arrows in a triangle means that the item is capable of being recycled. The numbers and letters act as identification for the recycling teams. Plastics are classified into one of seven categories, each one a different material that is more or less easy to recycle.
1 = PET, Polyethylene Terephthalate, and is widely recycled.
2 = HDPE, High-Density Polyethylene, and is also widely recycled.
3 = PVC, Polyvinyl Chloride, and is capable of being recycled but harder to do so, so check with your local authority.
4 = LDPE, Low-Density Polyethylene, also capable of being recycled, but check with your local authority.
5 = PP, Polypropylene, hard or not possible to recycle, so try to reuse or avoid it. PP is used in tupperware, disposable cups, and some food containers.
6 = PS, Polystyrene or Styrofoam, hard or not possible to recycle, so try to reuse or avoid it. PS is used in disposable coffee cups, plastic cutlery and packing foam.
7 = other. This is usually a mish mash of lots of different plastics and is pretty tricky to recycle.",
Mobius Loop,"The three green arrows going in a triangle simply means that it's capable of being recycled. Sometimes, the symbol will come with a percentage in the middle, signifying how much of it has been made from recycled materials.",
